# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for a normal linux system. \
My dotfiles for a system using nix or nixos are inside the `nix branch`.

## Requirements

- cmake
- make
- ripgrep
- lua-compat (lua v5.1)
- luarocks
- fd
- perl
- pip
    - neovim

## Installation

> **Note**: Running the script will override all directories of `~/.config/`
> which are listed inside `./config/`

> **Note**: This script will create symbolic links to the files inside this `./config/`.
> Therefore, make sure to not delete this directory after running the install script.

Run the install.sh script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Uninstall the dotfiles

> Once you have run the install script, an uninstall script will be generated to
> `./uninstall.sh`. To execute this script you **have to be in the same directory**
> as the script.

To remove all symlinks generated by `install.sh` run the following command:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```
